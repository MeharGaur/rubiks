# Rubiks

## Production

https://rubiks.web.app

----------

## Developing

Once you've installed dependencies with `npm install`, start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and automatically open it in browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```


## Building

```bash
npm run build
```

> You can preview the built app with `npm run preview`, regardless of whether you installed an adapter. This should _not_ be used to serve your app in production.
